## CouchDB
This is a **submodule**, not documentation for SolarThing. If you are looking for information about
setting up CouchDB with solarthing go [here](../other/docs/couchdb_setup.md).

### Info
CouchDB is a less popular database nowadays and so its Java library support isn't the greatest. Ektorp and LightCouch
are good, but are outdated. This aims to fix that.

This will be a work in progress for a while, and may not ever get used, but I really would like a
CouchDB library with immutable data that is easy to use.
