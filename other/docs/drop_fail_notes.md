## Drop Fail Notes
Contains some information on when drop failed


Drop failed scenarios:
* 2022.01.02 
  * buy (1,2): 23 
  * charge (1,2): 20
* 2022.01.04 
  * buy 1: 23 buy 2: 24 
  * charge (1,2): 20
* 2022.01.19
  * buy (1,2): 23
  * charge(1,2): 20
* 2022.01.24 (second generator run that day)
  * battery voltage: 29.4
  * buy (1,2): 23
  * charge (1,2): 19
* 2021.12.01
  * battery voltage: 28.2
  * tracer battery temperature: 79.84F
  * rover battery temperature: 77F
  * This failure is really puzzling because it does not seem like the FXs were in absorb mode

Drop success scenarios
* 2022.01.24 (first generator run that day)
  * battery voltage: 27.4
  * Note this run was far shorter than the second run that day
  * buy (1,2): 23
  * charge (1,2): 20
* 2021.11.26
  * battery voltage: 29.6
  * Absorb almost over (according to calculation)
